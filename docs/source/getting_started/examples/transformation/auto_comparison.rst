***************************************
Auto Comparison Between Multiple Models
***************************************

Following sections provide examples on how to perform automated model
comparisons using :mod:`tessif's analyze module <tessif.analyze>`.

A lot of subroutines are condensed inside the two major routines represented
by the :class:`~tessif.analyze.Comparatier` and the
:class:`~tessif.analyze.Verificier` classes.

To learn more about what is going on behind the scenes, please refer to the
mentioned classes as well as to :ref:`manual comparison guide
<examples_singular_transformation>` and maybe even to the
:ref:`basic transformation guide <Transformation>`.
