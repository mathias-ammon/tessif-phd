The developed model-scenario combinations serve following :ref:`key_goal`.
In addition to that, they also help addressing the more :ref:`practical_problems`.

.. _key_goal:

Key Goal
========
Develop reference supply system models in conjunction with relevant
and contemporary scenario formulations to test out modelling software.
	 
Thus the key goal can be divided into two parts:

1. Creating energy supply system models which can be subdivided further into
   two focuses: :ref:`component-focused-models` and :ref:`grid-focused-models`.

2. Formulating scenarios which is guided by the :ref:`key_modelling_questions`
   and are commonly labeled ``Commitment Problem`` and ``Expansion Problem``.

.. _component-focused-models:

Component Focused Models
------------------------
The component focused combinations aim to model following 5 behaviours:

  1. Integration of volatile renewable energy sources into an existing
     system.
  2. Integration of energy storage technologies into an existing system.
  3. Year-round, hourly-resolved energy demands based on ambient
     climatic conditions.
  4. Cost optimally dispatching energy sources to meet the system's demand.
  5. Reaching emission-goals cost optimally on given constraints, potentially
     expanding or adding certain low-emission components.

     
.. _grid-focused-models:

Grid Focused Models
-------------------
The grid focused combinations aim to model 4 behaviours:

  1. Transportation losses and maximum transportation capacities
  2. Grid congestions issues
  3. Subsequent need of redispatch
  4. Potential expansion of transportation capacities to avoid two and
     three
   
.. _key_modelling_questions:

Key Modelling Questions
-----------------------

1. Which of the available and controllable components is used when and to what
   extend to meet a certain amount of energy demand, while minimizing overall
   costs and respecting component and energy transportation constraints as well
   as potential secondary objectives like an emission-goal?

   Commonly labeled as ``Commitment Problem``

2. Which of the available/what new components have to be expanded/added to
   reach certain secondary objectives like emission targets, while minimizing the
   overall costs to do so, as well as respecting given component and energy trans-
   portation constraints, while still meeting all the energy demands?

   Commonly labeled as ``Expansion Problem``


.. _practical_problems:

Practical / Application Oriented Problems
=========================================
1. Given an expansion and/or commitment problem, what is the expected range of possible
   solutions using different softwares designed for the same purpose? Assuming different ori-
   gin leads to different presuppositions and focus of such softwar. Implying potential
   differences on what is modeled and thus potential result variance on equal input data.

2. Given the large number of possible software candidates, what would be the best software to
   perform a certain indepth analysis when modeling an energy suppy system?
