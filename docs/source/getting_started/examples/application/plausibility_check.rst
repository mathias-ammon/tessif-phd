.. _Application_Verification:

Plausibility Check
******************

When comparing energy system simulation models it is very important to verify that each of the utilized model components behaves as expected.

The :mod:`Application/verification <tessif.examples.application.computational_resources>` example module aggregates explanatory details on how to use tessif's :mod:`analyzing <tessif.analyze>` utilities for verifying component bahavior.
Further more it illustrates how these utilities can be used in a scientific context.
