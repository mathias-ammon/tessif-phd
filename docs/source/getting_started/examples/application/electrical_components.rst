Electrical Power Transfer Components
************************************

When comparing energy system simulation models different implementations for
modelling the same components is most often the reason for different results.

The :mod:`Application/electrical_components <tessif.examples.application.electrical_components>`
example module aggregates explanatory details on how tessif and it's models depict electrical
components, what their differences are, and how they impact the results.
