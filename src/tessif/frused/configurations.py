"""
:mod:`~tessif.frused.configurations` is a :mod:`tessif` subpackage aggregating
simulation parameters, used naming and unit conventions as well as some
logging behavior.

It serves as main reference point for adjusting tessif's simulative and
parsing behavior.

"""
Currently used temporal resolution. Must be one of the keys found in

node_uid_style = 'name'
"""
Switch for tweaking internal node uid representation style.

Useful for conveniently changing internal mapping behaviour. Must be one of
:attr:`~tessif.frused.namedtuples.node_uid_styles`.

Somehting like ``name`` allows for quick and intuitive node accessing while
sacrificing the possibility of 2 nodes having the same
:paramref:`~tessif.frused.namedtuples.uid.name`.

``qualname`` on the other hand maps everything to the fully qualified name.
Meaning only ever the full combination of all
:class:`~tessif.frused.namedtuples.uid` attributes has to be unique per
energy system.

.. warning::

    Tessif's doctests assumes ``node_uid_style = 'name'`` which is the most
    basic and intuitive way of mapping nodes. Designed for the use of
    relatively small energy systems (what ever that means).

For a list of available styles and their key (the string set to
:attr:`node_uid_style`) see :attr:`tessif.frused.namedtuples.node_uid_styles`.
