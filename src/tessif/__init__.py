"""
Welcome to tessif's API documentation. The content of this documentation
is structured exactly like the source code. So there will be no hidden secret
super long untrackable imports, inherits or stuff like that.

All of the subpackages are accessible via the table of contents below.
Each module of each subpackage has its own dedicated page. These packages
are also accesible via the table below but also via the table of content of
the respective subpackage.
